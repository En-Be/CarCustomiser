# Custom Car App

A simple product configurator application that can display a selection of car models, one at a time, and display the price and specifications of the selected model.

*Requirements*

The final version must run as a standalone application, either online or offline. The user must be able to do the following:

- Change the colour of the car, or add accessories, and have the price update to reflect the changes. All options can be hard-coded; there is no need for databases or saving to external files.

- Select, a different car model in the list.

The UI must display the following:

- Car model, specifications, and price. (the price should update if the material changes affect the price. Specifications can be fictional or copied from product websites. 

- Option to print out the list of models and relevant details

*Assets*

You are not required to model or create any 2D or 3D assets for this project. All UI, models, and other assets may be downloaded from asset stores, marketplaces, or other sources.

The car models do not have to be real/existing models, and the associated information can also be fictional.

*What are we looking for?*

Graphic quality and details are not important for this task, instead, want to see how you designed and created the functionality. The code is the focus.
We are interested in seeing how you use functions/methods, lists, and loop types.

*Deliverables*

A video walkthrough of your project where you explain how you created it and showcase how it works. Be sure to show and talk through your scripts as well.
