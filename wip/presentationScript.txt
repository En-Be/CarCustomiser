this is the assessment

made in unity with github for version control

took just under 20 hours to make spread over a few days

about three hour of that was styling, I just did that because I enjoy it

sessions fully tracked in the approach file (what I planned to do, what I did, how long it took)

loose pomodoro, delineated the aims and set a timer 

some sessions were longer

domain diagrams and wip images 

started with writing user stories from the requirements

rough ux layout including all features

hadn't done testing in unity before so had to figure that out

been a minute since I used proper processes, a bit rusty

got a bit stuck with simulating mouse clicks so scrapped that and just invoked the ui button methods

unit tests aren't perfect
- multiple assertions in some tests
- not completely comprehensive

things I would change:
- first script (turntable) could probably be simplified, too many methods
- prices are used in different places, could be encapsulated in a table to remove duplication (ui text and object value)
